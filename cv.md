## About me
Age: 22.<br>
Hobbies: digital drawing, skiing.<br>
Three strongest soft skills:
* critical thinking (I enjoy catching mistakes in my or others' work and I can also provide some help to those who need it),
* being very polite and non-conflicting (if you see a person abusing someone... it can't be me),
* being an organized person (I write down all my plans and follow them).<br>
  
Habits:
* no alcohol,
* no smoking.<br>

## Education
Russia, MSU, The Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, '22<br>

- [x] Operating systems, C
- [x] Programming systems, C++
- [x] Object Oriented Programming: C#
- [x] Object Oriented Programming: User Interface Design (a lil bit of XAML)
- [ ] Object Oriented Programming: .NET technologies

## Work experience
I don't have any work experience as a *developer*, but I worked as a *tutor* for children preparing them for the exams, and as a *teacher* in [Formula of Unity](https://www.formulo.org).<br>

In my uni I've made some studying tasks<br>
>I'm not sure if it works correctly, but I'll make it prettier to the time I make real CV<br>
>Anyway, you can see my *real* code examples here<br>
* [Simple Server](https://github.com/vera-fenric/spring2020) (C++)
* [Task for Computer Graphics](https://github.com/vera-fenric/KG-2020) - dynamic 3D model with some effects (C, C++, using freeglut)
* [App with UI for Windows](https://github.com/vera-fenric/Lab6) - practical task for learing SOLID, MVVM pattern (C#, XAML)

## Skills
* Git, GitHub
* C, C++, C#
* Some XAML
* SOLID
* MVVM pattern
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript ?
* I know how to Google:)

## Code example
This is my one-line solution for [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56747fd5cb988479af000028).<br>
```
function getMiddle(s)
{
    return s.substr(s.length/2-1+s.length%2/2,2-s.length%2);
}
```
>Usually, I don't use the shortest solution because it's harder to understand. I enjoy clear understandable code, and I can't imagine my life without comments.<br>

## Languages
* English<br>
My English level is B2 according to the test [here](https://test.str.by/). But I am having problems with grammar due to lack of practice. On the other hand, I feel confident enough with talking and understanding other people.<br>
In 2013 I travelled to London with my English teacher, but I'm not sure if I can consider this as a good practice, because I was way too younger than I'm now:)<br>

* Russian<br>
Russian is my native language.<br>

* German<br>
I study German in my leisure time.<br>
